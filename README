Run the file index.html directly on the browser. (i.e. file:///home/todos/index.html)

By default the 'Todos' view will display.  There's 2 links at the top of the page that toggle
between 'Todos' and 'Completed' lists.

In the 'Todos' view, you can:
1. Add new todos using the form.
2. View the todo list.
3. Toggle sort order by clicking 'Priority' heading in the table.
4. Toggle sort order by clicking 'Target' heading in the table.
5. Edit, Mark as Complete, or Delete the todo item using the buttons in the table row.

In the 'Completed' view, you can:
1. Delete using the button in the table row.


Note:
The todo and completed list are stored in memory so refreshing the browser will reset the entries.
This was done instead of storing the json in the filesystem so that you can run this without the need for a webserver.
This is also the reason why ngRoute was not used as well.
